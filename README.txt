== Description ==

A valuable piece of information is missing on the plugins management page in WordPress. The WordPress version the plugin has been tested up to.

This plugin fixes that, it adds a new column on the plugins page which shows **the version of WordPress that your plugins have been tested up to** *( according to the plugin author )*. It also applies **colors to spot potentially problematic plugins**.

The following colors are used:

- **Bold Green** - Tested on the exact same version you are using. *( No issues )*
- **Green** - Tested on the latest major release. *( Issues highly unlikely )*
- **Yellow** - Tested on the latest major release but not in the last 4 or more patch releases. *( Issues unlikely )*
- **Red** - Not tested on the latest major release. *( Issues are possible )*
